# Short Bio 

As of 2020, I am Associate Professor at Queen Mary University London and a Principal Scientist at Samsung AI Center, Cambridge. Prior to that, I was Associate Professor at the University of Nottingham, and Senior Research Fellow in the Intelligent Behaviour Understanding Group (iBUG), at Imperial College London. 

I received the Diploma degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Signal Processing and Computer Vision both from Imperial College London.

# Research 

My research interests are mainly in the problems of object detection and tracking, alignment and pose estimation, 3D reconstruction, super-resolution, and recognition with humans and faces being the focal point of my research. I have approached these problems mainly using tools from Mathematical
Optimization and Machine Learning. My current focus is on Compute and Data Efficient Deep Learning.

In the aforementioned areas, I have co-authored more than 60 publications (h-index 34, over 6,400 citations to my work according to Google Scholar), many of which in the most authoritative journals (IEEE TPAMI, IJCV, IEEE TIP) and conferences (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICLR) of my field. 

For a full list of publications see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=D4JkWxf-8fwC&hl=en&oi=ao).
