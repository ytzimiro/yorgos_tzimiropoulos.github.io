# Bio #

I received the diploma degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Signal Processing and Computer Vision both from Imperial College London, U.K.

As of 2020, I am Assistant Professor at the Queen Mary University London and a Principal Scientist at Samsung AI Center Cambridge.

From 2011 to 2014, I was Senior Lecturer with the School of Computer Science at the University of Lincoln and part-time Senior Research Fellow in the Intelligent Behaviour Understanding Group (iBUG), Department of Computing, Imperial College London. Prior to this, I was Research Associate in the same group. I am currently an Associate Editor of the Image and Vision Computing Journal.
